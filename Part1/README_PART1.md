## VSD BabySoC

**VSDBabySoC** is a compact yet powerful **System on Chip (SoC)** based on the **RISC-V** architecture.  
Its main goal is to enable the simultaneous testing of **three open-source IP cores** while also calibrating its analog components.

###  Key Components
- **RVMYTH Microprocessor** ‚Äì Handles data processing and instruction execution.  
- **8√ó Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)** ‚Äì Generates a stable, synchronized clock signal for all components.  
- **10-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)** ‚Äì Converts digital values into analog signals for external devices.

###  Working Overview
1. **Initialization & Clock Generation**  
   Upon receiving an input signal, the **PLL** activates and generates a stable clock. This clock synchronizes the RVMYTH and DAC, ensuring smooth, coordinated operation.

2. **Data Processing in RVMYTH**  
   The **RVMYTH** processor uses its `r17` register to store and cycle through values that are sent to the DAC. As instructions are executed, `r17` updates continuously to prepare data for conversion.

3. **Analog Signal Generation via DAC**  
   The **DAC** receives digital values from RVMYTH, converts them into an **analog signal**, and stores the output in a file named `OUT`. This analog output can be connected to external devices like TVs or mobile phones, enabling real-world multimedia interfacing.

## RVMYTH (RISC-V CPU)

**RVMYTH** is a compact RISC-V based microprocessor core that serves as the digital processing unit of VSDBabySoC. It executes instructions and manages data flow within the system. Specifically, it uses its `r17` register to hold and update values that are later sent to the DAC for conversion. This allows continuous digital data processing and streaming.

## 8√ó Phase Locked Loop (PLL)

The **8√ó PLL** is responsible for generating a stable and synchronized clock signal. When the SoC is initialized, the PLL locks onto the input frequency and multiplies it by 8, providing a high-frequency clock source for the RVMYTH CPU and DAC. This ensures all components operate in sync, avoiding timing mismatches and improving performance.

## 10-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)

The **10-bit DAC** converts digital values processed by RVMYTH into analog signals. These signals are stored in a file named `OUT` and can be fed into external devices such as TVs or mobile phones. This enables VSDBabySoC to interface with real-world analog systems, demonstrating how digital processing can drive multimedia outputs.

##  Role of Functional Modelling

**Functional modelling** plays a critical role in the development of BabySoC by allowing designers to **simulate and validate the behavior** of each component and their interactions **before physical implementation**.

Key roles include:

- **Early Verification** ‚Äì Ensures that the CPU, PLL, and DAC work correctly together in a virtual environment.  
- **Error Detection** ‚Äì Identifies design flaws, timing mismatches, or integration issues early in the flow.  
- **Faster Iteration** ‚Äì Enables rapid testing and modification of the SoC without the need for hardware.  
- **Design Clarity** ‚Äì Provides a clear functional view of how data flows through the SoC, from clock generation to processing to analog output.
